I realized the project in the LTSpice software environment. Within this project, I followed the operation of various circuits such as operational amplifiers, analog filters, amplifiers with programmable gain and rectifiers. After the dimensioning of each floor with the help of dimensioning equations and theorems, we followed the functioning of the circuits with the help of simulations such as: time analysis, DCOP, AC.
AC analysis calculates the frequency response of linear circuits and circuits
small signal equivalents corresponding to nonlinear circuits linearized in
the static point of the clerk. DCOP analysis determines the static operating point of non-linear elements.I used the transient analysis to track the linearity of the circuit.
